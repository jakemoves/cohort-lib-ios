A CUE unites a MEDIA ASSET, a MEDIA HANDLER (i.e. player), a TRIGGER, and a TARGET GROUP.

A SESSION handles ongoing functionality that needs to be run through the app delegate: audio, networking.

An EPISODE defines and loads one or more CUES, and primes TRIGGERS for them.

An EVENT creates TARGET GROUPS, MEDIA ASSETS, and EPISODES based on a JSON SHOWBOOK.
